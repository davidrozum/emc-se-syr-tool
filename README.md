# emc-se-syr-tool
An R script that parses SYR output and creates summary data

This repository contains the R script, the configuration file, and a sample SYR output for the syr_maint.r tool.

The tool is intended to provide an intro to R (primarily to the author).  However, it is used to summarize
maintenance information from the EMC SYR system.
